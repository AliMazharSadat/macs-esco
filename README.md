Developed a text analysis application capable of reading and analyzing module manuals for all degree courses offered at Hochschule Schmalkalden. This application identifies the most important terms within the manuals and correlates them to the ESCO skills and job dataset. The application serves as a valuable tool for students to make informed decisions about their career paths.
